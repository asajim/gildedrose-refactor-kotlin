# GildedRose Assignment

This project is a refactored version
of [the original one in GitHub](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
The requirement of this project can be found [here](./README.md)

## Refactor Details

* Original GildedRose and Item are not touched. This was done to ensure that any changes done on refactored code will
  behave similar as the original code (unless the conjured items).

## Assumption

* In requirement, it's not mentioned that "Aged Brie" will increase its value twice after the sellIn value less than
  zero. But turns the original code actually do that, thus I follow the original one approach.
